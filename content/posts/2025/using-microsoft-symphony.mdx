## üß™ Why Test Bicep with Microsoft Symphony?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) brings automation and consistency to cloud deployments, but testing can be a challenge. Bicep ‚Äî Microsoft‚Äôs domain-specific language for Azure Resource Manager ‚Äî simplifies infrastructure definitions. However, without proper validation, teams often encounter deployment issues that could have been caught earlier.

**This is where Microsoft Symphony shines.**\
Symphony orchestrates and executes workflows that automate validation, testing, and deployment of Bicep templates. Instead of waiting for a full deployment, you can run pre-deployment checks, validate parameters, and ensure everything is working before merging changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Symphony for Bicep Testing

### 1. Install Symphony and Dependencies

To get started, clone the Symphony repository and follow the setup instructions:

**Getting Started Guide**: [https://github.com/microsoft/symphony/blob/main/docs/GETTING\_STARTED.md](https://github.com/microsoft/symphony/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)

> üí° On Windows, using **WSL** is recommended for ease of setup.

```bash
# Clone the Symphony repo
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/symphony.git && cd symphony

# Login to Azure
az login

# Set the target subscription
az account set --subscription <TargetSubscriptionId>

# Source the CLI setup
source setup.sh

# Deploy Symphony dependencies
symphony provision

# Configure the orchestrator (GitHub or Azure DevOps, with Bicep or Terraform)
symphony pipeline config <azdo|github> <terraform|bicep>
```

During setup, you‚Äôll be prompted for:

* GitHub org and repo name
* Whether the repo should be private
* Whether to deploy private runners (**recommended**)
* Resource group and subnet ID for runners
* GitHub PAT for configuring secrets
* Whether to install sample workflows (**yes!**)

> üõ°Ô∏è **Tip:** Installing private runners provides a safer space to test, especially if any secrets are accidentally exposed. GitHub-hosted runners had minor compatibility issues for me during setup.

## üß™ PR Workflow: `workflow.pr.bicep.yaml`

This workflow is triggered when a **pull request to `main`** is opened, updated, or reopened. It automatically spins up a **temporary environment** to test infrastructure changes in isolation.

### üõ†Ô∏è What It Does

* Generates a unique environment name from a hash
* Validates the Bicep templates
* Stores environment metadata (commit SHA, name, etc.)
* Deploys the base branch to simulate the current state
* Overlays the PR branch to preview changes (`what-if`)
* Runs integration or functional tests (if configured)
* Automatically destroys the environment unless labeled to preserve it

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters

This approach ensures changes are previewed and tested **before** merging into `main`. You get fast feedback, catch issues early, and avoid last-minute surprises in production.

## üîÑ Continuous Integration Workflow: `workflow.ci.bicep.yml`

This workflow supports **manual CI execution** using the `workflow_dispatch` trigger. It‚Äôs ideal for deploying to environments like **dev**, **test**, or **qa**.

### üîß Trigger

From the GitHub Actions UI, specify:

* `environmentName` (e.g., `dev`)
* `locationName` (e.g., `australiaeast`)

### üìã What It Does

* Validates the Bicep templates
* Runs a `what-if` to preview upcoming changes
* Deploys the changes if validation passes
* Executes tests in the deployed environment

This gives you full control to test and deploy infrastructure changes as part of a structured CI process.

## üß™ What Symphony Does Under the Hood

Each stage of a Symphony workflow is powered by familiar, open tools ‚Äî which means you can extend, debug, or replace them easily. Here's a look at what happens during each major step:

### üîç Validate

Symphony's validation step includes two critical checks:

* **[GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)**\
  Scans the repository for accidental secrets and sensitive data (like passwords, connection strings, tokens, etc.). This helps catch security issues before anything is deployed.
* **Bicep Lint**\
  Runs `az bicep build` and syntax checks to ensure your templates are valid and follow best practices. This includes checking for missing parameters, unsupported properties, and invalid scopes.

### üîÑ Preview and Deploy

This step runs in two parts:

* **Bicep What-If Deployment**\
  Symphony uses `az deployment what-if` to show exactly what changes would be applied without actually deploying. This helps you catch unintended infrastructure modifications before they go live.
* **Actual Deployment**\
  After the preview, if everything is valid, the infrastructure is deployed using `az deployment create`. This uses your `.bicep` and `.bicepparam` files along with dynamic environment variables.

### ‚úÖ Test

Symphony uses **[Pester](https://pester.dev/)** (a PowerShell test framework) to validate the deployed resources.

Here‚Äôs an example of what a typical test file looks like:

```powershell
BeforeAll {
  Import-Module BenchPress.Azure

  $storageAccountResourceGroupName = $env:storageAccountResourceGroupName
  $storageAccountName = $env:storageAccountName
  $appConfigResourceGroupName = $env:appConfigResourceGroupName
  $appConfigAccountName = $env:appConfigAccountName
  $appConfigItemsLength = $env:appConfigItemsLength
}

Describe "End to End Tests" {
  Context "Test end to end" {
    It "should check the parameters and environment variables configured correctly" {
      $storageAccountResourceGroupName | Should -Not -Be $Null
      $storageAccountName | Should -Not -Be $Null
      $appConfigResourceGroupName | Should -Not -Be $Null
      $appConfigAccountName | Should -Not -Be $Null
      $appConfigItemsLength | Should -BeGreaterThan 0
    }

    It "should check the storage account is ready" {
      $storageAccountResource = Confirm-AzBPStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $storageAccountResourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName
      $storageAccountResource | Should -Be -Not $null
    }

    It "should check the storage account is configured correctly" {
      $storageAccountResource = Confirm-AzBPStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $storageAccountResourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName

      $storageAccountResource.ResourceDetails.ProvisioningState | Should -Be "Succeeded"
      $storageAccountResource.ResourceDetails.Kind | Should -Be "StorageV2"
      $storageAccountResource.ResourceDetails.Sku.Name | Should -Be "Standard_LRS"
      $storageAccountResource.ResourceDetails.EnableHttpsTrafficOnly | Should -Be $true
    }

    It "should check the app config is ready" {
      $appConfigResource = Get-AzBPResource -ResourceName $appConfigAccountName -ResourceGroupName $appConfigResourceGroupName
      $appConfigResource | Should -Be -Not $null
    }
  }
}
```

### üí° Want to Do More? Check for a Private Endpoint

To extend these tests, you can verify that the storage account has a **private endpoint** attached. Here's an additional test you could add:

```powershell
It "should have a private endpoint configured for the storage account" {
  $peResources = Get-AzBPPrivateEndpoints -ResourceGroupName $storageAccountResourceGroupName -TargetResourceName $storageAccountName
  $peResources.Count | Should -BeGreaterThan 0
}
```

This confirms that your storage account is securely accessible only from within your virtual network ‚Äî a common security best practice in enterprise environments.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Testing Bicep with Microsoft Symphony ensures issues are caught **early** in the development cycle. By automating validation, previewing changes, and testing before merging, Symphony empowers teams to ship infrastructure faster and safer ‚Äî with fewer rollbacks and more confidence.
