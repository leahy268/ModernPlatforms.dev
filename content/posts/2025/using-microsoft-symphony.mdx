## Why Test Bicep with Microsoft Symphony?

Infrastructure as Code (IAC) brings automation and consistency to cloud deployments, but testing can be a challenge. Bicep, Microsoft's DSL for Azure Resource Manager, helps simplify infrastructure definitions. However, without proper validation, teams often run into deployment issues that could have been caught earlier. This is where Microsoft Symphony can help.

Symphony allows you to orchestrate and execute workflows that automate validation, testing, and deployment of Bicep templates. Instead of waiting for a full deployment, you can run pre-deployment checks, validate parameters, and ensure everything is working before pushing changes.

## Setting Up Symphony for Bicep Testing

### 1. Install Symphony and Dependencies

To get started, clone the Symphony repository and install the required dependencies.

`
`

You'll also need the Azure CLI and Bicep CLI installed on your machine:

`sh
az bicep install
`

### 2. Define a Test Workflow

Create a Symphony workflow that validates a Bicep template before deployment.

\`yaml
workflows:
test-bicep:
tasks:

* name: "Validate Bicep"
  command: "az bicep build --file main.bicep"
* name: "Preview Deployment"
  command: "az deployment sub what-if --template-file main.bicep"
  \`

### 3. Run the Workflow

Use Symphony to execute the workflow and verify the Bicep template.

`sh
symphony run test-bicep.yaml
`

This will check for syntax errors and simulate a deployment to ensure the template works as expected.

## Automating with CI/CD

To integrate this into a CI/CD pipeline, add Symphony to your pipeline configuration. Hereâ€™s an example using GitHub Actions:

\`yaml
name: Bicep Validation
on: \[push, pull\_request]
jobs:
validate:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

* uses: actions/checkout\@v3
* name: Install Azure CLI
  run: az bicep install
* name: Run Symphony Workflow
  run: symphony run test-bicep.yaml
  \`

## Conclusion

Testing Bicep with Microsoft Symphony ensures that issues are caught early in the development cycle. By automating validation and previewing deployments, teams can avoid unnecessary rollbacks and speed up their infrastructure deployment process.
