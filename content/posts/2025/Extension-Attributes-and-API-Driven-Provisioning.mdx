Modern identity systems often require more than just first name, last name, and job title. With API-driven provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID, you can ingest enriched identity data—like cost centres, manager aliases, or internal classification codes—by mapping them to extension attributes.

This post explores:

* What extension attributes are
* How to register and use them
* How to map them in an API-driven provisioning workflow


## What Are Extension Attributes?

Microsoft Entra ID supports schema extensions to hold custom identity metadata beyond the default directory attributes.

There are two main types:

* **Directory extension attributes **(e.g., extensionAttribute1–15, often synced from on-prem AD)
* **Custom schema extensions** (e.g., extension\_{appId}\_{attributeName})

In API-driven provisioning, you can use either type—but custom schema extensions are preferred for cloud-native HR-to-Entra scenarios.


## Registering Schema Extensions

To register a schema extension:

```xml
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/schemaExtensions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "contosoIdentity",
  "description": "Contoso's HR identity extensions",
  "targetTypes": ["User"],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "employeeRegion",
      "type": "String"
    },
    {
      "name": "costCentreCode",
      "type": "String"
    }
  ]
}
```

```nginx
extension_contosoIdentity_employeeRegion
extension_contosoIdentity_costCentreCode
```

These can now be used in user objects, filtered in Graph queries, and mapped in API-based provisioning.

## API-Driven Provisioning and Attribute Mapping

In your Entra API-driven inbound provisioning setup:

Extension attributes from your source system (e.g. Workday, Aurion, SAP) can be passed in the payload

These values are mapped into Entra ID using attribute mappings like:

```json
{
  "sourceAttributeName": "region",
  "targetAttributeName": "extension_contosoIdentity_employeeRegion"
}

```

This lets you:

* Enrich the user profile with business context
* Drive access policy decisions (e.g., Access Packages or Conditional Access)
* Use these values in dynamic group rules

Tips for Working with Extension Attributes

Schema extensions are immutable once published (property names and types can’t be changed)

Avoid using extensionAttribute1–15 for new apps unless bridging with on-prem AD

You can patch values in users using Graph API after provisioning if needed

### Example Use Case: HR System Sends Division + Cost Centre

Imagine your HR system sends:

```json
{
  "userPrincipalName": "jane.doe@contoso.com",
  "division": "APAC",
  "costCentre": "IT045"
}

```

You map these to:

* extension\_contosoIdentity\_division
* extension\_contosoIdentity\_costCentre

Now, you can:

* Add users to dynamic groups by division
* Assign licenses by cost centre
* Create audit reports from Entra ID profiles alone

Wrapping Up

Extension attributes enable true identity enrichment in Microsoft Entra ID, especially when combined with API-driven provisioning. They allow IT and HR to meet in the middle—passing meaningful business context into the cloud directory, powering automation, access decisions, and governance.
