  Automating identity processes is essential for security and efficiency in
  modern organizations. Lifecycle Workflows in Microsoft Entra ID let you
  automatically onboard, move, and offboard users with zero manual effort. Set
  up triggers based on joiner, mover, and leaver events—then let Entra ID handle
  account creation, attribute updates, access provisioning, license assignment,
  and offboarding tasks. No more missed steps or security gaps: lifecycle
  workflows help ensure every user has the right access at every stage of their
  employment.

Manual identity processes leave too much room for error—missed terminations, delayed access, and inconsistent onboarding. **Microsoft Entra ID Lifecycle Workflows** solve this by automating identity tasks for joiners, movers, and leavers, based on user attributes and events. In this post, we’ll walk through how to configure lifecycle workflows, what licensing is required, and whether it’s the right fit for your organization.

***

## What Are Lifecycle Workflows?

Lifecycle Workflows are a feature within Microsoft Entra ID Governance that automate tasks based on user lifecycle states:

* **Joiner** → Account provisioning, group assignments, access packages, welcome emails, license assignments.
* **Mover** → Updates to roles, group membership, attributes.
* **Leaver** → Disable accounts, remove access, notify managers, and schedule deletions.

Everything runs via **no-code workflows**, triggered by time-based conditions (e.g. "2 days before start date") or attribute changes (like department or job title).

***

## Licensing Requirements

To use Lifecycle Workflows, you'll need:

* **Microsoft Entra ID Governance SKU** (previously known as Azure AD Premium P2 with Entitlement Management)
* **Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license** (assigned to each user in scope of the workflow)
* An Azure subscription for optional features (e.g. Logic Apps integration, external automation)

***

## Step-by-Step: How to Set Up a Lifecycle Workflow

### 1. Go to Entitlement Management

* Go to **Microsoft Entra Admin Center**
* Navigate to **Entitlement Management → Lifecycle Workflows**![](/uploads/Blogs/LifecycleWorkflows.png)

### 2. **Add Extra fields to your inbound provisioning.**

The real power of lifecycle workflows comes when you use auto triggering of lifecycle events (leaver, joiner, mover)

* Go to your enterprise App for inbound provisioning (See [https://modernplatforms.dev/posts/2025/entra-api-driven-inbound-provisioning](https://modernplatforms.dev/posts/2025/entra-api-driven-inbound-provisioning)) 
* Add attribute mappings for at least HireDate and employeeLeaveDate

### 3. **Create a New Workflow**

* Click **"Create workflow"**
* Choose a template (e.g., *Onboard pre-hire*, *Terminate user*)
* Give the workflow a name, description, and trigger condition (e.g., “On user’s hire date”)

### 4. **Define Scope**

* Select **target users** using filters (e.g., Department = 'Contractors', Job Title = 'Intern')
* Define pre- or post- start/termination timing

### 4. **Add Tasks**

* Choose from built-in actions like:
  * Assign licenses
  * Add to groups
  * Send email notifications
  * Disable account
  * Delay before deletion
* Optionally add **custom logic** via PowerShell or Logic Apps

### 5. **Publish and Monitor**

* Review the summary and publish the workflow
* Monitor executions under **Workflow history**
* You can **test** with a small user group before scaling

## Example: Offboarding Workflow for Contractors

| Step               | Action                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Trigger            | 1 day after `employeeLeaveDateTime` |
| Remove from groups | All contractor access groups        |
| Notify             | Email sent to manager and HR        |
| Disable account    | Entra ID account disabled           |
| Schedule deletion  | 30 days after disable               |

***

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

* **Automation = Less Human Error**
* **Repeatable & Auditable**: Clear logs and consistent logic
* **Security**: Timely offboarding reduces access risk.  Helpdesk staff no longer require create user access.
* **Integrated**: Connects with Entra ID, Access Packages, and External Tools

### Cons

* **Requires Premium Licensing**: Entra Governance isn’t included in base plans
* **Limited Custom Logic**: Advanced scenarios may require Logic Apps or Power Automate
* **Attribute Dependency**: Requires clean, reliable user data (e.g., hire/termination dates)

***

## When Should You Use Lifecycle Workflows?

Lifecycle Workflows are ideal when:

* You have regular staff turnover or contractor churn
* You already use Access Packages or Identity Governance
* You want to remove manual onboarding/offboarding processes

***

## Final Thoughts

Lifecycle Workflows bring scalable, secure automation to identity governance. When set up properly, they reduce IT workload, improve audit compliance, and ensure users get exactly the access they need—no more, no less.

If you're ready to ditch spreadsheets and manual tickets, Lifecycle Workflows are a powerful place to start.
