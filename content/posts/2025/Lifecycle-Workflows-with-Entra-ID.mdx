excerpt: >
  Automating identity processes is essential for security and efficiency in
  modern organizations. Lifecycle Workflows in Microsoft Entra ID let you
  automatically onboard, move, and offboard users with zero manual effort. Set
  up triggers based on joiner, mover, and leaver eventsâ€”then let Entra ID handle
  account creation, attribute updates, access provisioning, license assignment,
  and offboarding tasks. No more missed steps or security gaps: lifecycle
  workflows help ensure every user has the right access at every stage of their
  employment.
